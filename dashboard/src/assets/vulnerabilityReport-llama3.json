A specially crafted Socket.IO packet can trigger an uncaught exception on the Socket.IO server, thus killing the Node.js process. This issue is fixed by commit `15af22fc22` which has been included in `socket.io@4.6.2` (released in May 2023). The fix was backported in the 2.x branch as well with commit `d30630ba10`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may attach a listener for the \"error\" event to catch these errors.\n\nLocation List:\n  - socket.io:, \nCWE IDs: CWE-20, CWE-754\nCVE IDs: CVE-2024-38355\nSeverity: 80\nPriority: 80\nCategory: \n\n[/DATA]"

After updating to version 9.0.0, if you still intend to continue with signing or verifying tokens using invalid key type/algorithm value combinations, you\u2019ll need to set the `allowInvalidAsymmetricKeyTypes` option  to `true` in the `sign()` and/or `verify()` functions.\nLocation List:\n  - jsonwebtoken:, \n  - jsonwebtoken:, \nCWE IDs: CWE-327\nCVE IDs: CVE-2022-23539\nSeverity: 60\nPriority: 60\nCategory: \n\n[/DATA]"

      "description": "Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with an\nempty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to\nbe sent to the peer.\n\nImpact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences\nsuch as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue\ncould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent\nto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications\nthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of\nsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never\nbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by\naccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling\napplication.\n\nThe OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS\napplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN\n(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and\nis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more\nwidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of\nprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns\nthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the\nclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the\nfirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap\nbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is\ncalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and\nreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports\nthat there was no overlap in the lists).\n\nThis function is typically called from a server side application callback for\nALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list\nof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in\nlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never\nnormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the\nSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list\nsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the\napplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has\naccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has\naccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len\nparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\"\nresponse (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it\nwill be vulnerable to this problem.\n\nIn the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select\na protocol when there is no overlap.

In particular this issue\ncould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent\nto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications\nthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of\nsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never\nbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by\naccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling\napplication.\n\nThe OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS\napplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN\n(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and\nis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more\nwidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of\nprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns\nthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the\nclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the\nfirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap\nbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is\ncalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and\nreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports\nthat there was no overlap in the lists).\n\nThis function is typically called from a server side application callback for\nALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list\nof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in\nlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never\nnormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the\nSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list\nsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the\napplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has\naccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has\naccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len\nparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\"\nresponse (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it\nwill be vulnerable to this problem.\n\nIn the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select\na protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol\nin the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes\nfrom the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.\nHowever if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a\nclient_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the\napplication uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of\nconfidentiality will occur.\n\nThis issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most\nlikely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not\nwidely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.\nFinally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active\nexploitation unlikely.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.\n\nDue to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of\nOpenSSL at this time.

This can lead to XSS vulnerabilities and Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) attacks. **Strategic Solution**: To address these issues, we recommend implementing a robust templating engine with built-in protections against XSS and SSTI. Additionally, ensure secure data binding practices are followed throughout the application. Here are three key points to consider: * Use a templating engine that provides built-in protection against XSS and SSTI attacks. Handlebars is a suitable option. * Implement secure data binding practices by not compiling user-controlled data into templates. Instead, use placeholders or variables and bind them securely within the template. * Regularly review and update dependencies, configurations, and code to ensure ongoing security and prevent similar issues in the future. **Implementation Guidance**: To implement this strategy: 1. Assess current templating engine usage and identify areas where user-controlled data is being used. 2. Migrate to a secure templating engine like Handlebars. 3. Review and update code to follow secure data binding practices. 4. Conduct regular security audits and monitoring to detect potential issues early. **Long-term Considerations**: To ensure ongoing risk mitigation: 1. Continuously monitor and review dependencies, configurations, and code for vulnerabilities and updates. 2. Implement automated testing and scanning tools to identify potential security issues before they become major problems.",

This finding emphasizes the need for a robust approach to handling secrets across the organization's technology stack and development processes. **Strategic Solution:*** Implement a secrets management strategy that prioritizes confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data. Key points include: * **Centralize secret storage**: Designate a single, secure location for storing sensitive information, ensuring that access is restricted to authorized personnel only. * **Use environment variables or configuration files**: Consider utilizing environment variables or configuration files to store secrets, rather than hardcoding them directly into code. This approach helps maintain secrecy and simplifies the process of updating or rotating sensitive data. * **Implement secure logging and auditing**: Establish robust logging and auditing mechanisms to track access and changes to stored secrets, enabling real-time monitoring and incident response. * **Educate developers on best practices**: Provide comprehensive training and guidelines for developers on proper secret handling, emphasizing the importance of secrecy and the consequences of compromised information. **Implementation Guidance:** To implement this strategy: 1. Conduct a thorough review of existing codebases to identify hardcoded secrets or sensitive data. 2. Design and deploy a secure storage solution for storing sensitive information. 3. Update logging and auditing mechanisms to track access and changes to stored secrets. 4. Develop and disseminate comprehensive guidelines on proper secret handling, emphasizing education and awareness among developers. **Long-term Considerations:** To ensure ongoing improvement and risk mitigation: * Continuously monitor and audit the storage and use of sensitive information. * Regularly review and update security protocols to reflect emerging best practices and technologies. * Foster a culture of secrecy and data protection within the organization, encouraging developers to prioritize confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",

Conduct a thorough review of existing codebases to identify areas where consecutive `RUN` instructions can be consolidated.\r\n2. Develop and implement automated testing and validation mechanisms to ensure the effectiveness of configuration changes.\r\n3. Establish a regular review process for unconfigured HEALTHCHECK statements, prioritizing removal or update of such configurations.\r\n4.

These issues highlight the importance of maintaining up-to-date software and implementing robust logging mechanisms to detect potential threats. **Strategic Solution**: To address these underlying security concerns, we recommend a multi-faceted approach that focuses on ensuring the integrity of software components, improving logging practices, and fostering a culture of proactive vulnerability management. Key points include: * Prioritize regular updates for all software components, including ecstatic and glibc, to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities. * Implement robust logging mechanisms that provide real-time insights into system activity, enabling swift detection and response to potential threats. * Establish a vulnerability management program that includes continuous monitoring, threat intelligence integration, and incident response planning. **Implementation Guidance**: To implement this strategy, follow these general steps: 1. Identify all software components requiring updates and prioritize them based on severity and exploitability. 2. Implement logging mechanisms that meet organizational security requirements and provide real-time insights into system activity. 3. Establish a vulnerability management program with clear roles, responsibilities, and communication channels. **Long-term Considerations**: To ensure ongoing improvement and risk mitigation, consider the following suggestions: 1. Continuously monitor software components for new vulnerabilities and updates. 2. Integrate threat intelligence feeds to stay informed about emerging threats and exploit patterns. 3. Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential weaknesses and prioritize remediation efforts.",

This vulnerability is present in two instances, compromising input validation and potentially leading to security breaches.\n\n**Strategic Solution**:\n1. **Migrate to well-known sanitization libraries**: Implement a standardized approach to HTML sanitization by replacing manual `replaceAll()` calls with widely-used libraries like `sanitize-html` or `DOMPurify`. This will reduce the risk of human error and improve overall security.\n2. **Enforce proper configuration and usage**: Ensure that these libraries are properly configured to handle HTML escaping, and implement controls to prevent misuse or misconfiguration.\n3. **Leverage automated tools and testing**: Integrate automated testing and static analysis tools to detect potential vulnerabilities related to manual sanitization and enforce the use of recommended libraries.\n4. **Code review and refactoring**: Conduct regular code reviews and refactor code to eliminate manual sanitization practices, promoting a culture of security-aware development.\n\n**Implementation Guidance**:\n1. Identify instances of manual sanitization using `replaceAll()` in codebases.\n2. Install and import the recommended libraries (e.g., `sanitize-html` or `DOMPurify`).\n3. Configure the libraries to handle HTML escaping according to documentation and best practices.\n4. Implement automated testing and static analysis tools to detect potential vulnerabilities.\n5. Conduct regular code reviews to eliminate manual sanitization practices and promote secure coding practices.\n\n**Long-term Considerations**: To ensure ongoing improvement and risk mitigation, consider the following:\n1. Continuously monitor code changes for instances of manual sanitization.\n2. Regularly update libraries and configurations to reflect new security vulnerabilities or best practices.\n3. Integrate security awareness training into developer onboarding processes to promote secure coding practices.",
