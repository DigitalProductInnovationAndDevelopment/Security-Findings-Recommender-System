Browsers may allow \"nameless\" cookies that look like `=value` instead of `key=value`. A vulnerable browser may allow a compromised application on an adjacent subdomain to exploit this to set a cookie like `=__Host-test=bad` for another subdomain. Werkzeug prior to 2.2.3 will parse the cookie `=__Host-test=bad` as __Host-test=bad`. If a Werkzeug application is running next to a vulnerable or malicious subdomain which sets such a cookie using a vulnerable browser, the Werkzeug application will see the bad cookie value but the valid cookie key. The issue is fixed in Werkzeug 2.2.3.\\nCVE IDs: CVE-2023-23934\\nSeverity: 30\\nPriority: 30\\nCategory: CODE\\n-------    Solution    -------\\nShort Description: Upgrade Werkzeug to version 2.2.3 or later, as this issue is fixed in that version.\\nLong Description: [\\'**Step 1:** Upgrade Werkzeug to version 2.2.3 or later. This is the recommended and most effective solution to fix this security finding, as it addresses the issue of parsing cookies with unprefixed keys.\\', \\'**Step 2:** If upgrading Werkzeug is not feasible, implement a custom cookie parser that checks for the presence of an equals sign (=) in the cookie value. This can be done by adding a check before parsing the cookie to ensure that the key-value pair is correctly formatted.\\', \\'**Step 3:** In your application code, verify that the cookies received from Werkzeug are valid and correctly formatted. You can do this by checking the presence of an equals sign (=) in the cookie value and ensuring that the key-value pair is correctly separated.\\', \\'**Step 4:** Consider implementing additional security measures, such as validating user input or sanitizing cookie values, to prevent potential attacks or exploits.\\']\\nSearch Terms: Werkzeug WSGI library vulnerability, shadowed cookies, unprefixed cookies, nameless cookies, =value syntax, cookie prefixing, Werkzeug prior to 2.2.3, CVE-2023-23934, cookie exploitation, subdomain exploitation, Web application security\\n\\n\\n-------    Finding    -------\\nTitle: TCP, when using a large Window Size, makes it easier for remote attack ...\\nSource: Trivy\\nDescription: TCP, when using a large Window Size, makes it easier for remote attackers to guess sequence numbers and cause a denial of service (connection loss) to persistent TCP connections by repeatedly injecting a TCP RST packet, especially in protocols that use long-lived connections, such as BGP.\\nCVE IDs: CVE-2004-0230\\nSeverity: 30\\nPriority: 30\\nCategory: CODE\\n-------    Solution    -------\\nShort Description: Reduce the maximum window size to prevent remote attackers from guessing sequence numbers and causing denial of service attacks.\\nLong Description: [\\'<Step_1>\\', \\'<Step_2>\\', \\'<Step_3>\\']\\nSearch Terms: TCP large window size remote denial of service sequence number guessing BGP protocol vulnerability Trivy\\n'"
